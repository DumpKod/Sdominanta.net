Subject: Research‑friendly NV QPU concept + measurable safety KPI

Hello SSI team,
We propose a research‑friendly NV‑center QPU concept where logic is interference (modes), not registers. A single cell (NV + 4×13C) with microwave/RF control and photon readout exposes full researcher ergonomics: open pulse programming, calibrated timing, and built‑in telemetry (ODMR contrast, T2*, T1, coherence index T(t) with safety thresholds).

Suggested joint R&D:
(A) protected vs unprotected decay curves (γ_r↓ ⇒ longer time to T=0.5),
(B) two‑node phase linking,
(C) a small variational demo. 
We provide the bench outline, telemetry schema, and KPI math; you bring lab access and research priorities. If relevant, we’ll share a 2‑page note and schedule a 30‑min technical call.

Best regards,
